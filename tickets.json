The z12 processor is a model P01 replacing a z9 W01 - they both have similar processing characteristics but we are having significant issues with the performance on the new environment with the z12 CPU.  The z9 was running with 8GB of storage with 5GB+ allocated to main and 2GB allocated to expanded - where the z12 has 64GB and we have allocated 32GB to the second-level z/VM (5.4) and expanded is no longer supported.  We have seen much higher CPU contention and higher I/O rates when combined is causing slowness on the system that is negatively impacting our users.  We are looking for guidance to help with determining and reducing the causes of these issues."

Have noted that IBM closed TS002832050 which is similar and still unresolved by IBM - so TS002832050 has been reopened.\nRegards,\nDrago"

We are unable to detect where the situation is caused, and require your assistance with the debugging. \n\nThese are the symptoms: \nclients connecting to the \\\"reverse proxy ldap\\\" instance are getting SSL errors. Here is an example of  ldapsearch: \nldap_simple_bind: Can't contact LDAP server\nAttempted communication over SSL.\n  The extended error is 116.\n\nThe TDI process is still present, we see, and the query seems fetched from the backend LDAP, but the result is somehow not shown to the client connecting. \n\nOur only workaround is to restart the process, so we have written scripts to automatically check the service by doing an ldapsearch every 2 minutes, and restarting the service, if the ldapsearch doesn't return the proper results. \n\nHowever, this disrupts our nightly mass upload jobs, where we have no option to resume the process during the night, so our jobs then have to be resubmitted the next night (without guarantee of passing that time).\n\nThis far, we have tried setting the log levels to DEBUG via the log4j.properties (for the root class), but the logs don't show anything useful. \nWould it be possible to have a call for further debugging options please? It would really be appreciated. \n\nA conference call would be ideal, as we are with multiple colleagues looking into this issue, and would appreciate your expertise on this. \n\nAttached, you can find the configurations for DEV, TEST and QA, as well as the logs for an example of a crash in our DEV env today on 2020/03/11 at 13h46 (ldapsearch failure, after a timeout, which is suspected to be 5 seconds). \n\nHere is the version information: \n[root@spsla862 bin]# ./applyUpdates.sh -queryreg\nInformation from .registry file in: /opt/IBM/TDI\nEdition: Identity\nLevel: 7.2.0.5\nLicense: Full\n\nFixes Applied\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nSDI-7.2-FP0005(7.2.0.0)\n\nComponents Installed\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nBASE\n   -SDI-7.2-FP0005\nSERVER\n   -SDI-7.2-FP0005\nCE\n   -SDI-7.2-FP0005\nJAVADOCS\nEXAMPLES\n   -SDI-7.2-FP0005\nIEHS\nEMBEDDED WEB PLATFORM\nAMC\n   Deferred: false"

We have seeing this with `-gpu`, `-HCOLL`, and without.\n\nReuben has prepared a reproducer and placed all outputs and stack traces in: /gpfs/alpine/stf006/world-shared/reubendb/AST160_HangJobs\n\nI'm including the README in the directory below for reference:\nThis is a reproducer for an 86-node job that on occasionally hangs during an\nMPI collective operation (e.g. ALLREDUCE). From my test, the failure rate is\nabout 30% (e.g. 6 jobs out of 20 job submission hang until walltimed).\n\nThe files run2048N*.summit are submission script on Summit which can be\nsubmitted from any directory, provided the following directories are\navailable:\n- source\n- chk01000\n- sundials\nThe submission scripts include some scripting to collect JSM and the process\nstack on all the allocated compute nodes to gather more information if the\njob hangs.\n\nThe three submission scripts only differ in the `--smpiargs` argument:\n- one with `-gpu`\n- Nizedusiorialter`, Criel seems to hang at WAITALL\n- one without any\n\nThe directoried mentioned above contains the executable and needed input\nfiles (source), checkpoint from which to start the job (chk01000), and\nSundial library needed by the executable (sundials), set using\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH.\n\nThe directory \\\"FailedJobs\\\" contains outputs from previously hung job from my\ntests. The files and directory has the LSF JobID as suffix. Inside the\ndirectories, there are stack trace of this executable and JSM processes\n(obtained using `gstack`).\n\nThese jobs have a large input deck so unfortunately cannot attach them here but please let us know if you need additional information."

Is it being done continuously via IFI 306, and then also explicitly when requested log data is missing from IFI cache (another IFI 306 call)? \n\n2) Is the storage for IFI cache allocated in CDC's or DB2's address space ?\n\n3) Does CDC read log data of all objects enabled for replication in Db2 data sharing group? We have Qrep capture running for the same Db2 datasharing group, so I wonder, will CDC have to first read all log records (and only then see if they should become part of any commit group) of all the objects defined with DATA CAPTURE CHANGES (whether it was done for Qrep or CDC) even if these objects are not defined in any CDC subscription?\n\n4) How does CDC use filtering functionality provided with apar PM90568?\n\nThanks\nZiemo"

   "DESCRIPTION": "Hello,\nsince the time has changed to summer time, our developers found a problem with the date. Here is their explanation :\n When we issue a Resolve on the GUI, in FTM is created a Command PT (first screen ScreenPT.jpg) that contains a Command Transaction (second screen ScreenTxn.jpg).\nTo process the command, FTM read the values in the command transaction and starts an action (that is a piece of code).\nIn this piece of codes there is a new check (for 3.2) that fails and is logged in the Command Transaction Error log (third screen ScreenError.jpg).\nSince there is this error, the Transaction goes to failed status and the original Resolve command is not processed.\n\nNow, the error in the screen is misleading cause in \\\"actual\\\" and \\\"expected\\\" is printed the value of the same variable,  by the way the difference from the 2 timestamp that are checked is 1 hour.\nThe screen is important to IBM just to show that there's and error and is in that part of code.\n\nThe error, as said, happened only when we changed to summer time.\n\nThis is tests after a migration to IIB v10.0.0.16 + FTM v3.2.2.1\n\nI join the 3 screenshots we talked above, and the joblog of broker and execution group.\nNo message in either log....\nRegards,\nSeave Ifteally"

   "DESCRIPTION": "In very rare occasions, a mix of persistent and non-persistent messages is read out of sequence.\n\nThe scenario is the following:\n\n1.\tLocal queue Q1 is defined with Message Delivery Sequence=Priority and Default Priority=5.\n2.\tBatch job P1 puts several non-persistent messages (1-10) to local queue Q1 via alias A1 with priority=AQD.\n3.\tBatch job P1 puts one persistent message to the same local queue Q1 via the same alias A1 with priority=AQD.\n4.\tA commit is issued to RRS.\n5.\tQueue Q1 is consumed via alias A1 by process P2. In 99.999% of cases the non-persistent messages are read, as expected, before the persistent message.\nBut in some rare occurrences, the messages are read out of sequence, the persistent message is read before the non-persistent one.\n\nWe know that internally MQ has two sets of sub-queues, one for persistent messages, and another one for non-persistent messages.\nBut our understanding is that, under these conditions, the message sequence should be guaranteed. Nowhere in the documentation we found any restriction for the guaranteed sequence of a mix of persistent and non-persistent messages.\n\n\nImportant information:\n\n\tQ1 is a local queue with priority\n\tAll messages have the same priority\n\tMix of persistent and non-persistent messages\n\tOnly 1 putter and 1 getter process involved\n\tAll messages under syncpoint\n\tRRS as resource coordinator\n\tMQ V9.0 LTS\n\nMakedef of the queue and alias:\n\n* COMMANDS GENERATED FOR CSY3                                                   \nDEFINE NOREPLACE                                                       -        \n QLOCAL('P.SU.MQDR.UPOSITIONING.INP.01')                               -        \n QSGDISP(QMGR)                                                         -        \n STGCLASS('STGUPS13')                                                  -        \n CFSTRUCT(' ')                                                         -        \n CLUSTER(' ')                                                          -        \n CLUSNL(' ')                                                           -        \n DESCR('INPUT QUEUE FOR POSITIONING')                                  -        \n PUT(ENABLED)                                                          -        \n DEFPRTY(5)                                                            -        \n DEFPSIST(YES)                                                         -        \n MAXDEPTH(156000)                                                      -        \n PROCESS(' ')                                                          -        \n NOTRIGGER                                                             -        \n MAXMSGL(4194304)                                                      -        \n BOTHRESH(0)                                                           -        \n BOQNAME(' ')                                                          -        \n INITQ(' ')                                                            -        \n USAGE(NORMAL)                                                         -        \n SHARE                                                                 -        \n DEFSOPT(SHARED)                                                       -        \n MSGDLVSQ(PRIORITY)                                                    -        \n RETINTVL(999999999)                                                   -        \n TRIGTYPE(NONE)                                                        -        \n TRIGDPTH(1)                                                           -        \n TRIGMPRI(0)                                                           -        \n TRIGDATA(' ')                                                         -        \n NOHARDENBO                                                            -        \n"

(all usage was on general purpose processor no zIIP was being used) Recycling the HBOPROC along with HBODSPRO did not help. \nThere were no error or any other messages on the joblog for an indication of the high CPU usage. \nSo, we first took an SVC dump of both HBOPROC and HBODSPRO and then close HBOPROC temporarily. \nHBOPROC and HBODSPRO address spaces on the other LPARs are running fine. \n I'm uploading the joblog of HBOPROC from SYSB and the SVC dump.\nCan you please take a look and let us know the reason of this highCPU usage and how to solve it? \nIt is a little urgent as we can't have it running this way and stopping it impacts our log analysis capability. \nPlease let us know if any additional data is needed. \n\nRegards,\nAlper"

This causes security violations even though the new profile does have access.\n\nSteps we used to reproduce this issue:\n1) create test user with profile IINMDSNO\n2) log on to z/OS Explorer, the log off again\n3) change the ACF2 profile of the test user to IINMDZOS\n4) log on again to the same z/OS Explorer server, when accessing a dataset to which the new profile has access we get a dataset violation for the old profile\n\nWe tried clearing the security cache of the OMVS processes after changing the profile but the issue still appeared.\nThis appears to be related to the security cache of z/OS Explorer.\n\nI have included a zip with following files:\n- Shoredinalusialmothrottissennecatealteesse, Ide the rsecomm log for the test user\n- the RSED joblog\n- a word doc with an example of the issue and screenshots\n\nIs there some action we need to take for z/OS Explorer when we change security resources?

This is even after applying the  IJ24059m1a efix.\n \n On the handful of AIX LPARs that have been updated *ALL* of them have had their /etc/mail/aliases file disappear.  Mailing problems on several LPARs were corrected after restoring that file and running the \\\"newaliases\\\" command, with mail flowing once again for all but one of the LPARs and getting directed to our Domino server for distribution. (Note: All these LPARs have an identical senmail.cf file with the Domino server specified on the \\\"DS\\\" line.)\n  \nHowever, we continue to have sendmail problems on our most recently updated LPAR, where even though it has the identical sendmail.cf file as the other LPARs does not direct the mail to be handled by the server specified on the \\\"DS\\\" line, and continually only uses its own mail facility.  The aliases file has been restored to this box, and the above-referenced efix in installed. \n\nI am uploading to you a comparison of two nodes - the failing one and one that works.  I will also upload the sendmail.cf file that is the same on both these nodes.  Please let me know if there are any other efixes I need to install or what else I need to do to get mail working correctly on the problem node.  The problem is directly related to the AIX update work performed last Thursday.\nThanks,\n --Mark"

That's why I'm opening a new case and not reopening TS003427103.\n.\nWe are using a module that lab send to us to test if the problem was solved. Yesterday ptf UI69561 was released, but we didn't apply it yet.\n.\nWe need your help to find why Query Monitor caused these abends.\n.\nWe got two dumps. I'm sending both.\n.\nI'm sending also erep, syslog, query monitor syout.\n.\nBest regards, Silton"

It was performing this task for over an hour and it haven't finished (that was not a hangup - cursor was blinking on vmware console). I've rebooted HMC and it failed to boot. So, I've reverted to pre-update snapshot and tried the same once again. Similar effect - over 1,5h and it was still replacing UIDs and GIDs. Finally I've also reverted snapshot.\n\nCould you advise me what could be the problem? How can we solve it or try to update the console?"

Successful actions: 0 retries, 0 forwards, 0 discards\nCSQU203I 6245 messages remain on the dead-letter queue\nSee the entire uploaded xdc of the DLQ message processing by the DLQ handler in EBCDIC (the dataset DLQXDC.EBCDIC) \nand ASCII (the file DLQXDC.ASCII) format.\nThe entire output of the JCL job is included in the uploaded DLQXDC.EBCDIC and DLQXDC.ASCII.\n\nI can upload the messages on the DLQ before and after the DLQ handler processing.\nHowever they contain sensitive information. So I need first to know whether \nit is necessary. If so, should these data be uploaded in a different way than the usual data.\nWe collected this data using the q-utility in USS:\nstep 1) /u/a59g030/abasi00/mqbin/q -=300 -L10 -i QP12.DEAD.QUEUE -m QP12 -ddh3 > dlqdump\nstep 2) DLQ handler processing (see JCL job output in uploaded DLQXDC.EBCDIC and DLQXDC.ASCII).\nstep 3) /u/a59g030/abasi00/mqbin/q -=300 -L10 -i QP22.DEAD.QUEUE -m QP22 -ddh3 > dlqdump2 \n\nHow our MQ admins have to deal with processing these messages?\n\nWe'd like to be able to process the DLQ messages using the same DLQ handler procedure if possible.\nWe never had issues with processing the DLQ messages using the DLQ handler. \nIt is the fi"

   "DESCRIPTION": "For over the last year, one of the Lotus Domino servers at VEKA keeps approaching a system limit - # of message keys in a job. \nWhen you hit this limit the job stops and the Domino server needs to be restarted. \nHe has been keeping track of it and then doing a scheduled restart when it starts to get too high. \nDomino got sold by IBM to a company called HCL and HCL has not been able to do much about it so far. \n\nWe found out that IBM i will dump a VLOG when the job is at 50%, 75%, and 90% of the limit, but there's not much of interest in those.  \nWhen slic is about to hit the limit, it also cuts VLOGs for the last few messages that have the program stacks.  \n\nHowever, Christian restarts the job before the stacks are dumped because they need to have planned downtime, not unplanned.\n\nSo... we talked to a developer here (Jush Larregionsta) and she agreed to make a PTF that will dump some stacks to the vlog when the 50%, 75% and 90% levels are reached.\nIn this way, we will get several stacks from that job as it is using message keys, but will still allow him to restart the job in a planned way before it crashes. \nWe suspect that a lot of the stacks will be the same - and that will tell us (or HCL) what code is using all the keys.\n\nSo, we'd like to open a case, and an apar for Anna to use for the PTF.  She is in EX QSPACE - for CPS it is the Internals queue.   \nShe'll make a PTF, then when VEKA gets the VLOGS they would send them in via the case so she can make sure that everything is ok with the vlog output. \nVEKA would then share the stacks with HCL."

   "DESCRIPTION": "Hi IBM, \n\nwe are encountering issues when configuring channel authentication records with a hostname in the 'ADDRESS' property. It seems as if the reverse lookup for hostnames in channel authentication records is not working as expected. Only when we configure the rule with an IP it is working. \nThe 'REVDNS' property is enabled at the queue manager level and I can also confirm that a dns server is configured on the host system. \nAlso, our cluster sender and cluster receiver channels are configured with a hostname inside the 'CONNAME' property and the clustering setup is working fine so i would think MQ is able to do reverse lookups. \n\nTo demonstrate this I have configured an 'ADDRESSMAP' channel authentication record with a hostname: \n\nSET CHLAUTH('CL.MOM.ADMIN') TYPE(ADDRESSMAP) ADDRESS('s1106872.servers.kbca.be') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('JSD9901') ACTION(REPLACE)\n\n\nWith the amqsputc sample I tried to open a queue on queue manager SMTA over the above mentioned channel: \n\n$ amqsputc KBC.DELETED.Q08 SMTA\nSample AMQSPUT0 start\ntarget queue is KBC.DELETED.Q08\nMQOPEN ended with reason code 2035\nunable to open queue for output\nSample AMQSPUT0 end\n\n\noutput in queue manager log: \n\n+CSQX511I SMTA CSQXRESP Channel CL.MOM.ADMIN started 788                \n connection 10.152.33.13                                                \nICH408I USER(NOACCESS) GROUP(        ) NAME(???                 ) 789   \n  LOGON/JOB INITIATION - USER AT TERMINAL          NOT RACF-DEFINED     \nIRR012I  VERIFICATION FAILED. USER PROFILE NOT FOUND.                   \n+CSQX512I SMTA CSQXRESP Channel CL.MOM.ADMIN no longer active \n\nThe reason why we are seeing user 'NOACCESS' is because we have 'NOACCESS' set as the mcauser value in the channel definition. Usually if there is a matching channel authentication record the mcauser value of the channel is overwritten by the mcauser value defined by the channel authentication record but here it clearly isn't working as expected. \n\nBut then if we configure the same channel authentication record with an IP instead of hostname, it works perfectly and the mapping to the authorized user is applied: \n\nSET CHLAUTH('CL.MOM.ADMIN') TYPE(ADDRESSMAP) ADDRESS('10.152.33.13') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('JSD9901') ACTION(REPLACE)\n\n$ amqsputc KBC.DELETED.Q08\nSample AMQSPUT0 start\ntarget queue is KBC.DELETED.Q08\nTest message\n\nSample AMQSPUT0 end\n\nSMTA DIS CHS(CL.MOM.ADMIN)                                           \nCSQM293I SMTA CSQMDRTC 1 CHSTATUS FOUND MATCHING REQUEST CRITERIA        \nCSQM201I SMTA CSQMDRTC  DIS CHSTATUS DETAILS                             \nCHSTATUS(CL.MOM.ADMIN)                                                   \nCHLDISP(PRIVATE)                                                         \nCONNAME(10.152.33.13)                                                    \nSTATUS(RUNNING)                                                                    \nCHLTYPE(SVRCONN)                                                                                                                               \nQMNAME(SMTA)                                                             \nRAPPLTAG(amqsputc)                                                                                                                 \nRPRODUCT(MQCC)                                                                                                              \nMCAUSER(JSD9901)      \n\nCould you please assist us in determining why the mapping with hostname is not working as expected and how to resolve it? \n\nKind regards, \nStijn De Schutter"

   "DESCRIPTION": "We are migrating from Infiniband Coupling links to Coupling Express LR links. We have started the process on our Corporate Bank sysplex, without issues. \n\nAs part of this process we activated a new IODF last night that removed some of the Infiniband links on our Retail Bank sysplex and that introduced replacement CE LR links. \n\nWhen we did the hardware activate on the first processor we experienced a stall in a DB2 lock structure set-up for asynchronous duplexing. This resulted in an XCF dump and generated non-disruptive dumps of the two ICFs that hold the duplexed lock structure. \n\nWe experienced a spike in response times until the asynchronous duplexing was recovered (automatically).\n\nAdditionally, the processors called home to IBM. As a result we have a hardware call open with IBM. They have highlighted a potential MCL fix, although it is not clear yet whether this will fix the stall, the non-disruptive dumps or both.\n\nHardware call details:-\n\npmh 63265,019,866 2964 83-2A2CA - ZF1                         \npmh 63266,019,866 2964 83-2A49A - ZF2\n\nMCL fix - P08416.009 bundle S89 (11/12/2019)\n\nProcedure used for activation of IODF \n\n1) Configure offline all CIB channels that will be deleted by activation of IODF61. On both ZF1 83-2A2CA and ZF2 83-2A49A, for all z/OS and ICF lpars;\n2) On ZF1 activate, using HCD option 2.6.2, Activate software configuration only. Validate hardware changes. Process changes to functions and Coupling Facility elements on all z/OS lpars bar one;\n3) On the remaining z/OS lpar on ZF1, do a Hardware and Software activate to complete activation;\n\nFor 2) and 3) a test activate was performed first, prior to the actual activates.\n\nAfter 3) we experienced the issue we are reporting. \n\nOnce the response times recovered, we proceeded with the activation on ZF2. We experienced no issues with this.\n\nFollowing this we successfully configured online the new Coupling Express LR links.\n\nFurther Details\n-----------------\n\nWe activated IODF61, which did the following:-\n1) Removed 4 of 8 CIB links between ZF1 z/OS lpars and ICFRET2 on ZF2;\n2) Removed 4 of 8 CIB links between ZF1 ICFRET1 and z/OS lpars on ZF2;\n3) Removed 2 of 4 CIB links between ZF1 ICFRET1 and ZF2 ICFRET2;\n4) Added in the same number of CL5 links to replace the CIB links removed in 1) to 3).\n\nI will upload the XCF dump taken and the syslog from the timeframe shortly. Let me know if you would like any further diagnostics.\n\nCan you let us know if there are any z/OS issues or actions that we should be aware of?\n\nThanks,\nDave."

No issues with our production environment however when I went to reboot our Dev VIO servers, (two per each 870 setup for failover)  it took each server over two hours to come back online.  It looks most of the time was spent doing the discovery of the SAN storage with cfgmgr.  All of the devices are VSCSI devices presented back to the client LPARs to be boot devices.  We do the same reboot maintenance every quarter and did not have any issues back in November.  The Dev environment sits on different\nSAN storage then production.  I had the SAN team check for errors and they did not see anything on the SAN side."

When putting an advance reservation in place (typically for maintenance), all nodes are never up in a system the size of Summit.  However, before the reservation becomes active, nodes will likely recover but are not added to the reservation.  Is there a mechanism to allow a reservation to dynamically add nodes from a group (say compute in our case) as they become available?  We are accustomed to this feature in both Moab and SLURM.\n\nThanks,\nDon"

We have been working with Help Systems and they referred us to IBM support as this is a known bug with Java.  I'm pasting their notes they have on the issue below.  I reviewed their notes and our Java group PTF is much newer than listed so I would think we have the PTF.  Something they couldn't answer for me is if this is because we are running Virtual IP.  Any suggestions for next step is appreciated.  Thanks.\n\nThe iSeries is a Virtual Server.  IBM has provided a workaround that we can discuss with the customer, but it is not a good idea to offer it as a solution as their configuration may be different and this should come from IBM.  See case 35409.\nThe iSeries is using multiple network interface cards (NICs) and is using Link Aggregation.  This was voluntarily disabled to resolve case 37978.  It was reported to development, but I have not seen a response.\nCase 38797 is still open and the cause is yet unknown for sure, but the customer has the system configured to use a virtual MAC instead of the actual MAC and this appears to be the issue. \n \nNOTE:  A Solaris server with no MAC address was reported in case 36710.  Development says this issue has been resolved in version 5.2.1 but customers should upgrade to the latest version.\nNOTE:  I have seen one issue with a potential customer running on a hosted Linux on a VM and it was decided by the host company that it would not be possible for GA to get the MAC.  I haven't found the case number yet.\n\nFrom IBM (Case 38518):\n\n\\\"This issue we will fix it in the 6.0, 6.2.6,70.7.1 and 8.0 32bit and 64bit at all IBM i OS VRMs in the CR16_02, the schedule of CR16_02 is at the end of June , The PTFs will be included in following group ptfs:\nIBM i 6.1 OS : SF99562 level:36\nIBM i 7.1 OS : SF99572 level:25\nIBM i 7.2 OS : SF99716 level:10\nIBM i 7.3 OS : SF99725 level:2\\\"\nFix for 7.1 JDK60 32-bit is PTF SI60245\n\n\nSince I have confirmed the fix will be included in the next IBM i Java Group PTF due out at the end of June and your current issue is resolved, would it be ok to close the PMR at this time? \n \nENVIRONMENT                                                            \n===========                                                             \nIBM i 7.1                                                              \nSF99572 - 24 - installed                                               \nJDK 6.0 32bit                                                          \n                                                                        \nPROBLEM                                                                \n=======                                                                \nGoAnyWhere Linoma Java application is failing to successfully retrieve \nthe IBM i ethernet MAC addresses using JDK 6.0 32bit.                  \n                                                                        \nBUSINESS IMPACT                                                        \n===============                                                        \nHigh - critical application they need to get working.                  \n                                                                        \nACTION TAKEN                                                            \n============                                                           \nThe issue occurred after applying the latest IBM i CUM/Java Group PTFs.\nAfter reviewing the problem description, I believe this issue is a match\nto CPS DI # A7EUER.

We bounced ldap and the users were able to connect.  This error occurs on the 15th of every month and we determined it is when security team runs the Nessus scan.  The error occurs in QUSRDIR every time the scan runs on all systems, but one or two systems SSO works and the others don't.  \n\nToday we had a triage with the security team trying to figure out what Nessus is running that is causing the problem and we could not recreate the issue where we could not log on using SSO, but every time QUSRDIR received and GLD0113 error.   The Nessus version : 8.9.0\nPlugin feed version : 202003060110.\n\nThe first time we removed user authentication part of the scan., then removed GP policy, then removed ports 389 and 636 from the scan, scanned only port 21, then removed all ports and they all caused the error.   We then tried the same scans using Nessus defaults. All caused error.  I then tried changing ibm-slapdDbConnections from 4 to 10 has Jared mentioned in previous case, but same results.\n\nWe then tried running nmap for port 636 then again for ports listed in the attachment, but had same results. ran a nmap IP addresses and it still caused error.\n\nEach time we were able to log on using SSO.  We believe these errors should  not be occurring and do not know if its contributing to the SSO problem.  Another scan will be occurring on 3/15 and was hoping to get additional information.\n\nNote: the scan runs on all systems at the same time."

We would like to know the problem, so we can avoid reoccurance. \n\nHereby the short feedback from BMC:\n\nThere were 10 corrupted entries in DSN=BMCCS.C0837744.SMFSSKC\nFrom these I observed the following IFCIDs (all statistics)\n\nIFCID  FREQUENCY   DESCRIPTION\n0001     02                       System Service Stats\n0002     02                       Database Stats\n0202     02                       System Parameters (from Stats)\n0230     02                       Data Sharing Global Stats\n0225     02                       System Storage (from Stats)\n\nThese were in series as follows:\n\n0001, 0002, 0202, 0230, 0225  <== all corrupted QWHS\n0003 - ACCOUNTING Record which was completely intact\n0001, 0002, 0202, 0230, 0225  <== all corrupted QWHS\n\nRegarding the time.\nThe QWHS Store-Clock value for the first corrupted record (IFCID 0001) was:\nD7729D2D66272452\nwhich translates to:\nFeb 10, 2020\n00:16:51.868274\nGMT\n\nThe principal problem is in the QWHS common IFCID header where the QWHS_MOD_LVL is populated with EBCDIC blanks.  We inspect the modification level and cannot process SMF data populated with blanks.\n\nMaybe important to know: all Db2 subsystems were restarted with a conditional restart around that day/moment.\nFe 'DKC2', in local time: \n\tconditional restart on 01.16.46 STC24859 ---- SUNDAY,    09 FEB 2020\n\tStopped on 01.27.20\n\tNormal start 01.27.43 STC24950 ---- SUNDAY,    09 FEB 2020\n\nThis issue was already discussed with Bart Steegmans (IBM) and this case can be routed to him (cfr. Bart).\n\nI've sended the SMF data type 100 from the 9th and 10th feb.\n\nPlease advice,\nJeroen."

   "DESCRIPTION": "We are having issues in which some of our 5250 sessions wont restart because there is an entry that remains in NETSTAT. \nThis seems to be related to us switching network providers from ATT to Verizon. As our manufacturing locations are cut over to the Verizon circuit these locations are experiencing 5250 printer and display sessions that are becoming disassociated or orphaned from the iSeries server.\nBy disassociated I mean when I send a request from the thin client (CLI brand) to end/disconnect the session it isn't removing the entry in NETSTAT; therefore, I cant get the writer to go active until I remove the entry from NETSTAT. We are also trying a method of closing the session for about 10-15 minutes to see if it will allow the NETSTAT entry to clear. This does affect both printer and display sessions.\nOnce the entry is removed from NETSTAT I can start/stop the session from the client and see the the entry be added/removed from NETSTAT and of course the writer will stop and start as expected.\nThis is an ongoing issue at those locations that have cut over to Verizon happening on a regular basis. I also would like to add that weve had at least one IPL. \n\nMy network guys insist that the Verizon service should be the same. Maybe faster. They are interested in getting this resolved and are curious of the cause. Im certain that its something on their end I just dont know what to have them look for. Since these sessions have been working properly for over 15 years and continue to not be an issue at those locations still on ATT, I dont want to fiddle with settings on our AS400 until weve exhausted options on the network side of things.\n\n\nWhat do you suggest would be the likely things for me to have my network guys look for or compare between the two services?\n\nPTFs and Group have been attached.\n\nThank you for your time!\n\nSincerely,\n\nWeron Ecrableas"

   "DESCRIPTION": "Hi,\n\nDue to some new MiFid Directives, we have to check the timestamps on our LPARs.\n\nTo do so, we want to use NTP commands. This is working fine on OPEN servers but it is actually not working when the request is sent to z/OS LPARs which means that the check is working everywhere except for z/OS LPARs. \n\nThe command used is NTPDATE. So the control sends an NTPDATE request to the LPARs IP address on port 123 (NTP port) and waits for an answer. But there is no answer (except: unreachable). The request is sent over UDP.\n\nOur question:  what has to be implemented / started in order to be able to respond to these NTP requests sent to our LPARs? \n\nKind regards,\nRobert"

And sometimes it's just the MCH6909.\n\nI found the following information but I am unsure of what to do as to debugging....\n\\\"In some cases, a memory leak can cause the single-level store heap to become fragmented to the point that the heap control segment is full and deallocates fail. This problem is indicated by an MCH6906 message. In this case, the only solution is to debug the application and fix the memory leak.\\\"\n \nAlso have a job that I was informed about this morning that was found to have been running for a while that when ended, was taking 7% of the disk space.

   "DESCRIPTION": "Hello\n\nWe are currently running DB2 V12 FL 100 and have a very strange problem.  \nWe have an SQL that when executed in a local websphere application gets after a few minutes an SQLCODE -904 because it used all the available space in our workfile database. However, when we execute the exact same SQL locally in TSO Spufi or in a distributed fashion on the same DB2 member with DB Visualizer the SQL terminates successfully in less than two seconds elapsed time. DB Visualizer is a JDBC based tool allowing execution of dynamic SQL, the version of the JDBC driver used is the same as for the websphere application, the only difference being that one connection uses the type 2 and the other the type 4 connectivity. We noticed that in WAS the SQL executes a tremendous amount of getpages and that it uses different indexes, so that we conclude that DB2 uses different access paths in both cases.\nThe project needs to be fully functioning in about 3 weeks so right now we could only bypass the problem and tell them to try to rewrite the SQL to get it to work.  They will not start immediately the rewriting to give us a chance to reproduce the error and collect all the information you may need to gain some insight. However, in 2 weeks at the latest they would have to begin the rewriting if we do not come up with another solution.  \nHere the error produced in WAS:\nSQLCODE = -904, SQLSTATE = 57011, error tokens = 00C90084;00000100;WRKDB4P\nERRORCODE=-904, SQLSTATE=57011       \n\nHere the SQL involved:\nWITH                                                                            \n    PERSONNES_AVEC_CB_EU                                                        \n    (                                                                           \n        CBEU_MEMBRE_ID,                                                         \n        MATRICULE,                                                              \n        DATE_DELIVRANCE,                                                        \n        PAYS_CBEU                                                               \n    ) AS                                                                        \n    (                                                                           \n        SELECT                                                                  \n            D1.FK_MEMBRE_ID,                                                    \n            PS1.PERS_UNIQUE_ID,                                                 \n            D1.DEMA_DATE_CHANGE_ETAT,                                           \n            CASE                                                                \n                WHEN P1.PAYS_CODE_EUROSTAT IS NULL                              \n                THEN TRIM(P1.PAYS_CODE_ISO2)                                    \n                ELSE TRIM(P1.PAYS_CODE_EUROSTAT)                                \n            END                                                                 \n        FROM                                                                    \n            AEIMM.TS_DEMANDE D1,                                                \n            AEIMM.TS_CATEGORIE C1,                                              \n            AEIMM.TS_PAYS P1,                                                   \n            AEIMM.TS_MEMBRE M1,                                                 \n            AEIMM.TS_PERSONNE PS1                                               \n        WHERE                                                                   \n            C1.FK_DEMANDE_ID = D1.PK_DEMANDE_ID                                 \n        AND C1.FK_ETAT_CATEGORIE_ID = 4                                         \n        AND D1.FK_ETAT_DEMANDE_ID = 9                                           \n        AND C1.FK_TYPE_DEMAN"

Create AD with Shift +1 day, valid from within LTP range\n2. Run Modify LTP job\n2. Copy newly created AD with new valid from +1 week after valid from of first version & within LTP range\n4. Run Modify LTP job => abend with EQQN043I VSAM RETURN CODE IS 8, REASON CODE IS 0012\n\nSteps to reproduce v2:\n1. Create AD with Shift +1 day, valid from within LTP range\n2. Run Modify LTP job\n2. Copy newly created AD with new valid from outside LTP range\n4. Run Extend LTP job to include newly defined AD => abend with EQQN043I VSAM RETURN CODE IS 8, REASON CODE IS 0012\n\nFurthermore after running the Modify LTP job and causing this problem, the LTP VSAM was corrupted and we had to restore the backup to be able to rerun Modify LTP job succesfully. After Extend LTP job abends, it is possible to rerun it succesfully after changing AD definitions, unless a modify LTP job has ran in the meantime, then LTP backup has to be restored aswell."

Nella parte sinistra dello schermo si vede il log della partizione di Produzione. In quella di destra il log della partizione di Flash.\nSino al messaggio \\\"L'accesso all'ASP è sospeso\\\" i messaggi sono identici come tipo ed orario ( entrambi i messaggi sono alle 06:40:11 su entrambe le partizioni) \nDal messaggio dopo che segna la separazione dei LOG (in quanto a questo punto la partizione di Flash si avvia e ha il suo proprio LOG) si nota come nella partizione di Flash il primo messaggio successivo all'ultimo comune \\\"Lavoro 000000/QSYS/SCPF avviato il 12/05/20 alle '7:30:29\\\"  indica chiaramente come nella partizione di Flash l'ora sia stata cambiata in modo drastico..\n\nQuesto comporta poi che tutti gli orari scritti nel log del BRMS siano sbagliati.\nOra una volta completato il backup la partizione di Flash trasferisce i dati necessari al DB del BRMS sulla partizione principale e si spegne.\n\nQuesto comporta che il log del BRMS che si legge sulla partzione principale riporti un'ora sbagliata.\n\nInfatti come si vede dall'altro allegato si nota come l'operazione del Maintenance sembra esser stata avviata alle 09:52:19 e cioè nel bel mezzo di una operazione di Backup...\n\nL'errore è che tutti gli orari relativi ai processi di Backup come ad esempio:\n 12/05/20   9:54:59  Save of list *LINK completed with errors.  \nsono in realtà stati eseguiti circa un ora prima..\n\nA cosa può esser dovuta quest'orario non corretto nella partizione di Flash..?\n\nGrazie mille per il supporto.\n\nAttendo un vostro gentile riscontro in merito.\n\nVolon Truce\nPer conto di Suzuki Italia Spa"

I think this is a very high MAXSPACE, and we don't know we can increase it. We saw that in V12, we had to increase a lot. We used 40.000 MEG, increased to 60.000 and than to 80.000, but it seams never is enough. And as I know that complete dumps are very important for diagnostics, and in the past we saw that DB2 was writing many areas with zeroes and spaces, spending a lot of space of the dump, I'd like to please ask you to review the dump and see if there is anything that can be done to decrease the space of the dump.\n.\nI'm sending the dump and the syslog.\n.\nBest regards, Silton"

   "DESCRIPTION": "Hi\nI reported Case TS003704640 that our IASP went down when we upgraded to 8.3.1.1. The support wanted me to create a ticket to you.\n\nWhat we did was the following\n1. Upgrade the V5010 to Version 8.3.1.1, no microcode for disk drives since they are at the latest level.\n\n2. The upgrade went good without any problems.\n\n3. logged into lpar FSYS and looked into the logs, we then saw Jush Dity was Vary OFF. Customer called us that they had problem to connect to the system, and we informed that we are activating IASP since it went down.\n\n4. Just did a quick look and found for ex CPI096F, CPPEA35, CPPEA33, CPIB711\n\n5. WRKCLU opt 10, and display session told us that FYSBACK was in replication status \\\"Suspend\\\",  so we did a \\\"RESUME\\\", which only went to \\\"RESUMEPEND\\\". This was because the iASP was Varied Off. So we changed the replication status back to \\\"Suspend\\\" and Varied On the iASP, and then we did \\\"RESUME\\\" the replicatoin state again, and the replication started to sync.\n\n\nYes customer have VIOS1 and VIOS2 NPIV for fiber connection\nPlease let me know what you need, and also a good instructions on how to collect the data\nThank you and regards Sandra"

Na AIXu pi pipojení pomocí NFSv4 dochází k chyb, od dodavatele máme vyjádení (níe), pro NFSv3 ve funguje.\n\n---\nWith the NFS version 4 protocol, the support for file locking is part of the NFS protocol. The file locking support is structured so that an RPC callback mechanism is not required. This is a departure from the previous versions of the NFS file locking protocol, Network Lock Manager (NLM). The state associated with file locks is maintained at the server under a lease-based model. The server defines a single lease period for all states held by an NFS client. If the client does not renew its lease within the defined period, all state associated with the client's lease may be released by the server. The client may renew its lease with use of the RENEW operation or implicitly by use of other operations (primarily READ).\n\nThe failure we are seeing at this customer site is on a fcntl call to establish a read lock, so the customer should really ask the question of IBM as to why the lock request returns einval with NFSv4 and not NFSv3.\n\nIn other words this is not a problem with our code per se, but with the NFS implementation.\n---\n\nDkuji\nPetr Kozák\neská Spoitelna, a. s."

They experienced some iconv issues when they coded content type as \\\"Content-type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1\\\". The message suggested this was an invalid charset. The error went away when they replced that with \\\"Content-type: text/plain; charset=ISO8859-1\\\", so without the first dash. They claim now that this is erroneous, since ISO-8859-1 is the standard way to specify it according to them. So my question is: do they have a point and if so, is there a possibility to make sure ISO-8859-1 is (also) accepted?\nKind regards, Swesso Wenamern"

Based on IBMs recommendation of keeping the SMF MANx DSNs around in case we need to go back to DATASET recording - we have Automated several commands and messages to make sure the SMF data is always dumped in the order that it was created.  For instance, we trap the SETSMF RECORDING command and check to what we are changing the recording method.  Then if going from LOGSTREAM to DATASET, we issue our command to offload the SMF LOGGed data to the common GDG.  If going from DATASET to LOGSTREAM then message IEE391A is generated by the system which starts our normal SMF dump process.\nWe also coded and tested for message IXG283I and dump the SMF LOGGed data after every 3 times it is produced for a logstream with IFASMF in the logstreamname.\nWe thought we were golden.\nThen we started playing with Digital Signing.  We created a new SMFPRMxx member and kept everything the same as the other SMFPRMxx member expect we added the TOKEN and HASH parameters.\n\nTo turn this testing, we thought we would enter SET SMF=nn where nn in our case was 15.  We were already in LOGSTREAM mode since we previously issued the SETSMF RECORDING(LOGSTREAM).  When the SET SMF=15 was issued, we went back to DATASET recording and obviously Digital Signing does not work with DATASET recording, but that was not the big issue, but the fact that if we did not realize that it switched back to DSN recording, we would not have dumped the SMF data from the LOGGER file and the data would have been out of order or missing.\n\nIs there a command that can return the SMF RECORDING setting ?\nCan you put out a message that indicates the the recording medium has changed ?\n\nWe want to be able to Automate it all."

To avoid this problem we have automation bounce KCTPROC whenever we see the KLVRS002 error.\n\nWhen we reported this issue before, we were advised to apply the following fixes:\nUA99841 \nUA98643  \nUA98644 \nUA98845\n\nThese fixes are applied in all of our Omegamon LPARS and we have also applied the recommended service for Omegamon up to early September 2019.\n\nI have attached the 2 system dumps created by the KLVRS002 errors and the Logs for the NI and WS KCTPROC tasks. \n\nHave you any further ideas on how we could tackle this problem?"

   "DESCRIPTION": "We are currently running z/VM 6.4 RSU 1702+ soon to migrate to 7.1.\nOur primary z/VM system just passed 1 TB of real memory and continues to grow.  IBM used to recommend using the same DASD geometry for all paging packs (and spooling) for performance. Based on this we have continued to add Mod 9s and are now up to 144. Along with spool packs we are begining to get close to the 256 limit for slots. We have 8 channels to each controller and will soon be implementins z/HPF(HDS disk, per mgmt decision). We are now preparing for a DASD refresh and are wondering: \n1. Does IBM still recommend keeping all paging (and spooling) on the same geometry? or could we go to a mix of Mod 9 and Mod 27 (or Mod 54)\n2. Would there be any performance issues going from Mod 9 to Mod 27 (or Mod 54)? \n(We are not interested in EDEV for this function at this time.)\nAny guidence you can give us in this area would be helpful. \nTerry"

   "DESCRIPTION": "We've been experiencing some slowness on transferring data between partition sdssdb2p9601 and sdssdb2t6703.  I have captured perfpmr data from the six partitions involved in the transfers:  sdssviop2903 & sdssviop2904 which are the VIO servers that manage sdssdb2p9601.   sdssviod3056, sdssviod3057 manage i/o to sdssdb2t6703.  I personally feel the issue may be in sdssdb2t6703 as it seems sluggish for some reason, which I am hoping the perfpmr can help point out where the issue is.    I will also capture snaps from each and upload them."

I have z/OS 2.2 and 2.3 KC books and 2.3 PDFs in /sharedapps/kc4z/data/content per the read.me at /systems/z/zos/sftp/kc . CICS/TS 5.4 is next.\n\nI have two questions: 1) What is the process and 2) What is the source for the CICS docs that can be used with/installed under KC4z?\n\n1) Process\nPer the \\\"CICS Transaction Server for z/OS 5.4.0> What documentation is available?\\\" web page, CICS PDFs are available for KC. Following the \\\"Downloadable documentation\\\" link there is a section \\\"IBM Knowledge Center for z/OS®\\\" which says \\\"... you can use the z/OS Softcopy Librarian feature to load CICS TS documentation into this version of IBM Knowledge Center. See Using IBM Knowledge Center for z/OS for more information.\\\" Note the reference to Softcopy Librarian which per case TS003547736 is \\\"obsolete.\\\" \n\nBut, just in case, I cranked up Softcopy Librarian and opened the \\\"CICS TS and Performance Analyzer\\\" source. Opening the source file I get a choice of three zip files and the option to \\\"Send to\\\" either of my repositories, one of which is KC \\\"/sharedapps/kc4z/data/content/\\\" and the other is the Library Server shelves that I maintain for PDFs not available in KC. Is it safe to send one of the zip files to /sharedapps/kc4z/data/content/? And what do I do with it once there?\n\nFollowing the \\\"Using IBM Knowledge Center for z/OS\\\" link, in the third paragraph I read \\\"You can manually add content to Knowledge Center for z/OS by copying it to z/OS directories. You can also automatically add content using the z/OS SoftCopy Librarian tool. By adding content, you can make Knowledge Center for z/OS serve product publications for many different IBM products.\\\" Note the reference to Softcopy Librarian again. In the same sentence \\\"You can manually add content to Knowledge Center for z/OS by copying it to z/OS directories.\\\" and the fifth paragraph includes a link to \\\"IBM Knowledge Center for z/OS Configuration and User Guide.\\\"\n\nChapter 3. Managing product documentation content in Knowledge Center for z/OS of the User Guide, \\\"Adding content manually to Knowledge Center for z/OS, for a product, is possible if you copy product plugins to a content directory yourself, build and add your own product properties file to a conf.path directory, and register (if necessary) the product id with the Knowledge Center taxonomy file. The details for manually provisioning content are detailed in the following procedure: ....\\\" \n\nWhat or where are the \\\"product plugins\\\" for CICS? Where do I find the information to populate the \\\"product.properties\\\" file, register the product in the Knowledge Center taxonomy file, and edit the KC_taxonomy.ditamap file? \n\n2) Source\nThe Softcopy Librarian found zip file mentioned above (2nd paragraph of Process).\n\nThe /systems/z/zos/sftp/kc FTP site has a file \\\"SSGMCP_5.4.0.jar\\\" which I would imagine is compatible with \\\"receive.sh\\\" but the date (04-Jun-2019) doesn't match any of the seven downloads, the latest is 2/5/20, at the second source.\n\nThe /software/cics/knowledgecenter FTP site has multiple versions of the CICS 5.4 documentaion in zip files.\n\nWhen un-zipped contain either a folder with the PDFs (cicsts540_pdfs_2020.01.30.zip) or multiple folders with the PDFs (cicsts540_pdfs.zip) but neither contains the referenced read.me in \\\"IBM Knowledge Center for CICS products\\\" \\\"The documentation is available at CICS information download site.

We have a Keystore library that contains DECRYPT, ENCRYPT, and KEY files.  When a user, a programmer or version control, go to add the fieldproc and encryption they take the following steps:\n1. Create a dupe column and copy data over to the encrypted column.  This works perfectly.\n2. In a separate program, the user then runs a script to:\na. allocate KEY, DECRYPT, and DECRYPT.\nb. Remove triggers\nc. drop unneeded columns\nd. update comments on the file for our data dictionary\ne. reattach triggers\nf. deallocate objects\n\nWhat ends up happening is somewhere between b and e, our file is becoming corrupted.  It appears to me that it might be dealing with the authority of the user running the programs that may not have authority to the Keylib.  Typically, it seems to happen in step D, which adds comments onto the new encrypted fields.\n\nWhat could be causing this corruption?  If it is the authority, what do we need to set the authority at on the Keystore so we can avoid corrupting the file (both at the library and object level)?"

This happened on both cluster nodes immediately after the first reboot with AIX 7.2. Subsequent reboots did not change anything.\n\nThe failed Etherchannel is part of the Oracle Cluster Interconnect configuration. On the partner node (LPAR on our second E880 server) the equivalent configuration failed under the same cirumstances. Trying a rmdev/mkdev resulted in error message \\\"Error terminating device from driver\\\". On the other cluster node a cfgmgr ended with \\\"Error initializing a device into the kernel\\\".\n\nSince we could not resolve the problem in the available maintenance window we restarted the cluster nodes using old_rootvg (AIX 7.1) und everything was OK. \n \nI know from a previous ticket (\\\"EEH errors and failed Etherchannel failover on E880 AIX 7.2 LPAR\\\", TS003300641) that there are a number of known issues with the underlying interface (PCIe3 100/1000 Base-TX 4-port Converged Network Adapter (df1020e214103c04)), see http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1SSRVPOAIX61HIPER181110-1747 and https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IJ10293.\n\nAccording to the IBM documentation adapters using the 'lncentdd' and 'lnc2entdd' drivers are affected.

Each time it restarts, a bunch of tables goes to idle state.\n\nWe also observed the follow message in the replication events:\n\nType: Error\nEvent ID: 9.816\nOriginator: com.datamirror.ts.target.publication.optimizer.bulkapply.TargetBulkApplyOptimizerJob\nTime: 22 de mai de 2020 06:21:28\nMessage:\nThe UOW that was being applied when subscription DWABBEL0 last ran was only partially applied. CDC has processed the maximum number of operations a UOW could have without seeing the bookmark that terminated the UOW: 00520003C4F3F4F6C4F3C7F400D7F4941DC7A8A3CC000006000000000001715587DF700000D7F492C997BDCF54000001000000000000B5E730E42963000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000. Please refresh all tables in the subscription, or run the subscription in adaptive apply mode until the subscription mirror bookmark is past the bookmark that terminated the partially-applied UOW.\n\nWe tried to Restart incremental update processes from dwa-console, and the accelerator process restarted by itself, but the behavior of CDC doesn't change: the subscription continue to stop/start many times. Each time more tables whent to idle state.\n\nBecause more of 2/3 of our replicated tables were puted in idle state, and we must do a full refresh of those tables, we decided to do a disable/enable incremental updates and create a new subscription.\n\n\nI'm sending a default trace with extensive diagnostic information and the sysout of the CHC STC.\n\nWe know that we lack in the upgrade to version 7.5.1 and IBM Synchronization but, until that happen, can you help us to understand the problem? We must make the CDC work fine with V7 until the upgrade."

No cleanup DDDDEF and DATASET.\nThat's correct ? \nI say that because i checked and the DATASETs are always there and the DDDEFs also. \nSo when i copy a FMID by MERGEZONE or BUILDMCS, there stay to cleanup with the previous step the olders TARGET/DLIB and remove DDDEF. \nCan you confirme me this ascertainment ?\n\nBest Regards"

   "DESCRIPTION": "Patched to aix 7200-04-02-2016.\nHad issues with mail.  I see that sendmail was re-worked in this aix level.\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_aix_72/filesreference/sendmail.cf.html\nThe doc (that I can find) is not very helpful.\n\nMy mail config is simple.  We do not run sendmail.  We allow outgoing mail only.  My only custom config is:\n1.  DS entry in sendmail.cf (relay host)\n2.  aliases in aliases\nNever any problems with mail - until NOW.\nSo I finally got mail working to my mail address by adding\nentry for #D{MTAHost}  in submit.cf with my relay host.\n\nBut I cannot get aliases to work.  \nFor example, I have alias named frankp -\nfrankp:     borsonvedenomis@maskedemail.ibm.com\nI run mail in debug  ( -vvv)  and see the following -\n>>> MAIL From:<bdow@maskedemail.ibm.com> SIZE=1080\n250 sender <bdow@maskedemail.ibm.com> ok\n>>> RCPT To:<egedin@maskedemail.ibm.com>\n250 recipient <egedin@maskedemail.ibm.com> ok\n\nNote - the alias does not get resolved.\nYes, I do run newaliases.   How do I fix?  Thx.\n\nPS -  any other major changes in 7200-04-02-2016?\nAny doc that lists changes?"
